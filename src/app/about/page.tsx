          <p>Some projects need a product partner. Others need a technical team that can untangle an existing platform, build the next release, or prepare the infrastructure for scale. Origins is designed to cover that full range.</p>
          <p>Our approach is deliberately senior-led: small teams, direct communication, thoughtful documentation and an emphasis on decisions that remain useful months after launch.</p>
